He is able to fly, he has superspeed, laser vision, super strength, and many more abilities he doesn't even know about. When he becomes Ultraman he keeps his identity hidden by wearing a mask over his eyes and head. He only has one arch nemesis and that is Codeman. Codemanâ€™s abilities are very odd as well he shoots code out of his hands to defeat his enemies. Codeman has never been able to beat Ultraman at least not yet "

     <h1>The Story of Ultraman</h1>
     <p> Zachariah Mahaffey is a temp by day and Ultraman, a superhuman with multiple abilities, by night. He is able to fly, he has superspeed, laser vision, super strength, and many more abilities he doesn't even know about. When he becomes Ultraman he keeps his identity hidden by wearing a mask over his eyes and head. He only has one arch nemesis and that is Codeman. Codemanâ€™s abilities are very odd as well he shoots code out of his hands to defeat his enemies. Codeman has never been able to beat Ultraman at least not yet. </p>
